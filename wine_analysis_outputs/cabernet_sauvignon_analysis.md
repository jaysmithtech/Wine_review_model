================================================================================

Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the most celebrated and widely planted grape varieties in the world, known for its bold flavors, robust structure, and aging potential. Based on the provided wine data, we can identify several common descriptors and characteristics that are often associated with excellent Cabernet Sauvignon wines, particularly those from California, a region renowned for producing high-quality examples of this variety.

### Common Descriptors for Excellent Cabernet Sauvignon:

1. **Fruit Flavors:**
   - **Blackberries, Black Currants, and Cherries:** These dark fruit flavors are a hallmark of Cabernet Sauvignon, providing a rich and luscious profile. For instance, the 97-point Redmon Cabernet Sauvignon is noted for its "masses of blackberries, black currants, cherries, and cassis," showcasing the depth of fruit character typical of top-tier Cabernets.
   - **Cr√®me de Cassis:** This descriptor, found in the 93-point Hunnicutt wine, indicates a concentrated blackcurrant flavor, often associated with ripe and opulent Cabernets.

2. **Oak Influence:**
   - **Toasted Oak and Smoky Oak:** Oak aging contributes to the complexity of Cabernet Sauvignon, imparting flavors like vanilla, smoke, and toast. The 93-point Hunnicutt and 90-point Duckhorn wines both highlight the presence of oak, enhancing their richness and depth.

3. **Tannins:**
   - **Refined and Firm Tannins:** Tannins provide structure and aging potential. The 97-point Redmon is described as having an "ultrarefined tannic structure," which is crucial for balance and longevity. Similarly, the 90-point Duckhorn mentions refined tannins, indicating a smooth and polished texture.

4. **Acidity and Balance:**
   - **Graceful Acidity:** A well-balanced Cabernet Sauvignon will have sufficient acidity to counterbalance its fruit richness, as seen in the Redmon wine, which is noted for its "graceful acidity."

5. **Complexity and Elegance:**
   - **Complex Cherry and Blackberry Flavors with Earth and Herbs:** The 94-point Clos du Val Cabernet Sauvignon is praised for its complexity and elegance, with flavors that include earth and herbs, adding layers of interest beyond the fruit.

6. **Aging Potential:**
   - **Ageability:** Many excellent Cabernets are noted for their ability to age gracefully. The Redmon wine is described as ageable for at least a decade, while the Clos du Val is expected to develop until at least 2021.

### Recommendations:

For those seeking a classic and elegant Cabernet Sauvignon, the 94-point Clos du Val offers a refined style with complex flavors and a long aging potential. It is ideal for those who appreciate a more traditional approach to winemaking, with a focus on balance and subtlety.

For enthusiasts of modern, fruit-forward Cabernets, the 97-point Redmon provides a dramatic and richly detailed experience, with a perfect balance of fruit, tannins, and acidity. This wine is suitable for both immediate enjoyment and long-term cellaring.

Overall, excellent Cabernet Sauvignons are characterized by their rich fruit flavors, oak influence, refined tannins, and balance, with the ability to age and evolve over time. These wines are versatile and can complement a wide range of dishes, from grilled meats to hearty stews.
