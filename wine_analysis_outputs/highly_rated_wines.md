Highly rated wines, those scoring 90 points and above, often exhibit a combination of complexity, balance, and distinctiveness that sets them apart. Based on the provided wine data, several key characteristics can be identified:

1. **Complexity and Structure**: Highly rated wines often have a complex structure, with multiple layers of flavors and aromas. For instance, the Bordeaux-style Red Blend from Château Mouton Rothschild, rated at 98 points, is noted for its "impressive purity of fruit" and "mouth-watering acidity," which contribute to its elegant structure. Similarly, the Bordeaux-style White Blend from Château Rieussec, with a 97-point rating, is described as "concentrated and dense," with a "great structure of richness and sweetness."

2. **Balance**: Balance is a crucial factor in high ratings. Wines that integrate their components well, such as acidity, tannins, fruit, and oak, tend to score higher. The Bordeaux-style White Blend from Château Larrivet Haut-Brion, rated 93 points, exemplifies this with its smooth integration of wood and ripe yellow fruits, resulting in a rich and creamy texture that is well balanced.

3. **Elegance and Refinement**: Wines that are described as elegant often have a refined quality, with subtlety and finesse. The 98-point Bordeaux-style Red Blend from Château Mouton Rothschild is praised for its elegant structure, while the 97-point Bordeaux-style White Blend from Château Rieussec combines power with elegance.

4. **Distinctive Aromas and Flavors**: Highly rated wines often feature distinctive and appealing aromas and flavors. The Verdejo from Valdelainos, rated 90 points, offers "citrus and piquant green-fruit aromas" along with "honeyed melon and lime flavors," showcasing a unique profile that contributes to its high score.

5. **Potential for Aging**: Wines with the potential to age well are often rated highly. The Bordeaux-style Red Blend from Château la Louvière, with a 90-point rating, is noted for its "firm tannic structure" and "intense acidity," suggesting it will develop further complexity over time.

**Recommendations**:
- For those seeking a white wine with both power and elegance, the Château Rieussec Bordeaux-style White Blend is an excellent choice, especially for those who appreciate a rich and sweet profile with a hint of honey.
- Red wine enthusiasts looking for a structured and elegant option should consider the Château Mouton Rothschild Bordeaux-style Red Blend, which offers a harmonious balance of fruit and acidity.
- For a more affordable yet highly rated option, the Valdelainos Verdejo provides a refreshing and distinctive profile at a great value, making it suitable for casual enjoyment or pairing with light dishes.

Overall, highly rated wines are characterized by their complexity, balance, and the ability to offer a memorable tasting experience, often with the potential for further development with age.
